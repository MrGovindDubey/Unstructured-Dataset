I am a journalist by profession and expose the wrongdoings and financial frauds happening in the society. My sister is a lawyer.Due to exposing the financial frauds and wrongdoings happening continuously in the society, I and my sister are being repeatedly targeted in this group. A few months ago, obscene and derogatory things were written against me by Deepak Sharma and other members, on which I lodged a complaint. Deepak Sharma apologized in that case, and I forgave him.Now again a bank officer, Nitesh Sharan, who currently lives in Bihar but his flat is in our society, is continuously writing objectionable, obscene and mentally harassing things against me and my sister in this group. Both of us sisters are mentally very disturbed by his behavior.The group admin Deepak Sharma is neither deleting these messages of Nitesh Sharan nor blocking him from the group, which clearly shows his negligence. We also tried to explain to Nitesh Sharan by calling him, but he did not stop his actions.Due to this act of Nitesh Sharan and the negligence of Deepak Sharma, I and my sister are under a lot of mental stress. This is clearly a violation of Cyber Bullying, Mental Harassment, and various sections of IT Act, 2000.I request you to1. Take strict legal action."

"I am facing cyber bullying and harassment. My photo was on a campus election poster and it was posted in a group formed during a social movement in the campus. Just before election, either my competitors in the election or somebody at their bidding have taken that photo from the group, put inciting words on it, and posted it on a public Instagram platform. The words are meant to stir up religious and political tensions, and hence qualifies as hate speech and harassment. This is not only an invasion of my privacy, but also opens me up to threats from extremists from all over the country. I have attached the usernames of those instagram handles along with the screenshots of the posts. I expect immediate removal of such posts infringing my privacy and severe actions and these accounts and peoples related to these activities."

"Respected Sir/ Madam, I, Devesh Kumar Mishra am writing this formal complaint to bring to your attention an alarming case of cyber bullying and harassment, including serious threats of physical injury that I, along with a family member, have been subjected to via social media. I maintain an online presence with the username (sachinmiishra) on the  the social media platform Instagram. On 07/09/2024, I received several comments on my posts that were menacing in nature and clearly intended to cause fear and psychological distress. These comments were made by the user with the handle aman_lifts123. In addition to derogatory and abusive language, this individual made explicit threats of physical harm directed toward me. The nature of the comments included statements that I would be physically harmed and suggested that they would take violent actions against me. I have attached screenshots of the threats as evidence (Annexure1). What makes this matter even more distressing is that the individual did not limit the threats to just me. They also directed their aggression toward my family member, whose social media handle is (celestial.kingsley). In similar threatening messages, the individual warned of physical violence toward this family member, which has caused us great concern and fear for our safety. Screenshots of the threats against my family member are also attached (Annexure 2). Both I and my family member feel  aggrieved, and are living in constant fear due to such threats."

"A few days ago, I mistakenly downloaded an unknown APK file after receiving a link on WhatsApp about a PM Kisan Yojana App. Upon investigation, I found an APK named CSC installed on my phone, which had unauthorized access to my messages and contacts.  This APK caused all incoming messages, including sensitive banking and transaction messages, to be auto-forwarded to an unknown number 9883526105. All transaction messages I received over two days were sent to this number. Upon advice from bank authorities, I deleted the number on 04/01/2025 at approximately 1 PM, but the messages were still being forwarded. After careful examination, I uninstalled the CSC application at 11 PM, after which the message forwarding stopped.  I remain deeply concerned about the potential misuse of my data before uninstalling the application. I request the Cyber Crime Cell to investigate this matter, take appropriate action, and guide me on securing my information. Relevant details and evidence are attached to assist with the investigation."

"I received a call from a number 8240096068 in morning 10.15 AM, and he asked me to update the PNB KYC, where i have my saving account. Then he shared me one apk file on whatsapp with number 9168178107 and asked me to install the apk and complete the KYC process. His watsapp profile pic and truecaller id is also PNB, so i believed him. The moment i installed the apk, all of sudden i started receiving multiple OTPs from mobikwik, hdfc, phonepay and onemny for login. Got secret otp from hdfc as well. I have transferred all my money to other accounts so that i wont be cheated. Later after having a call with PNB customer care, they told me to file a complaint on this portal.I also got a call from 9078865633 which i suspect to be same fraud."

"On 20.12.2024, I received a Bank of India APK file on WhatsApp from a fake Bank of India group. I installed it by mistake. After that, all my bank OTPs started getting forwarded. I uninstalled the APK file within 1 minute (at that time, there was not much amount in the account, only Rs. 8.22), but the OTPs were still getting forwarded. Then I blocked a number on which the OTPs were getting forwarded. Still, all the OTPs (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Bank of India Office Application) were getting forwarded to different numbers. When I blocked one number, it was forwarded to another number. After that, I rested my phone. Even after that, the OTP was not getting forwarded. I went to the bank and gave the information and changed the registration number in the bank (from 7014185576 to 9460035097), still the OTPs were getting forwarded. After that, I closed the bank account on 30.12.2024 and on 30.12.2024 I bought a new SIM (number 9116499655) and a new phone on 2.1.2025. Opened an account in SBI through video call KYC. As soon as KYC was completed, my account was opened and all those bank OTPs also started getting forwarded."

I woke up and saw the message on WhatsApp claiming to be PNB since I have my savings account in PNB. The message stated to contact customer care with a 10 digit number starting with plus 91 along with an apk file to download which I am pretty sure is a scam. Suspected mobile number from which I received the message on WhatsApp is 8810307047. I did not open the message and checked the suspected number on true caller where it was showing Preeti Rani. I have attached the suspected message along with the true caller search. Kindly take a look into the matter and resolve the issue to save the citizens from cyber crimes and frauds.

"Dear Sir/Madam,I am writing to formally report a case of fraud that I recently encountered involving a WhatsApp group. This incident has caused me considerable concern, and I believe it is crucial to bring it to your attention for further investigation and necessary action.On 01/01/2025, I was added to a WhatsApp group by an unknown individual. The group appeared to include other unsuspecting members as well. Shortly after joining, the group administrator or a member shared a message urging everyone to download an APK file from a provided link, claiming it was necessary for accessing certain benefits or information.The link and the APK file were suspicious, and I refrained from downloading it. However, I am deeply concerned about the potential harm this might cause to other members who might not be aware of the risks involved. This kind of fraudulent activity not only compromises personal data but could also lead to financial losses or identity theft.I request your urgent intervention to investigate this matter. Kindly take appropriate action to identify and penalize the perpetrators behind this scam. It would also be helpful to raise awareness about such fraudulent activities to prevent others from falling victim."
